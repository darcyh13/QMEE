#influence of genotype and background and sex on WL with random intercepts for each replicate -> each rep is assigned different intercept value and this mixed model should estimate these intercepts 

#maximal model <- lmer(WL ~ genotype + background + sex + (1 | rep), (1| individual) Genetic_Background_Interactions)
#I did not include individual number as females were numbered 1-10 for each geneotype in each replicate and males were numbered 1-10 for each genotype in each replicate. So individual is nested in replicate but I dont know how to handle when sex also influences individual numbering. In addition it seems to simply be an ID (not my data) and that there would not be an effect to ID.  

summary(lmm1)
#sd shows how much variability in the wing length there is due to replicate. 
#residual show variability thatâ€™s not accounted for -> factors that effect wing length that are included in dataset
#Can compare effects of fixed effects. Different genotypes and sex have effects on wing length. Looks like sex has the strongest effect. 
#correlation of fixed effects is not about correlation of variables but correlation of of regression coefficients 

plot(lmm1)
#residuals look to be around 0 so I think this looks good.

#plot looks good does not look underdispersed or overdispersed. 
#I think plots look good. 



#I think model looks good but I want to tell if random effect is significant. compare models with and without. 
#looks like there are cautions when testing to see if random effect is significant but I am not sure what these are. 
lm1<- lm(WL ~ genotype + background + sex, Genetic_Background_Interactions)

anova(lmm1,lm1)

#models look very similar. Therefore, replicate as a random effect is not very strong.
