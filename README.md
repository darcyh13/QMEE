# QMEE

Dataset includes genetic background effects of mutations influencing vein development.

Data is obtained from set of experimental crosses and data collected by Andrew Victory while an undergraduate at MSU in the Dworkin lab. 

column 1: background.  wild-type genetic background in which the crosses were made (2 backgrounds Ore & Sam).
column 2: gene1. Mutations at first locus (in addition to rhomboid/rho).
column 3: gene2. Mutations at Second locus (in addition to rhomboid/rho).
column 4: rhomboid. Whether these individuals are homozygous for the rhomboid mutation (causing a shortening of the longitudinal veins).
column 5: rep.   replicate blocks used in the experiment (since it was large and could not all be done at one time).
column 6. sex.   The sex of the fly being measured.
column 7. individual. Just an id for the fly.
column 8:  L2 . Length of the L2 longitudinal vein.
column 9:  L3 . Length of the L3 longitudinal vein.
column 10: L4 . Length of the L4 longitudinal vein.
column 11: L5 . Length of the L5 longitudinal vein.
column 12: WL . Length of wing (as a covariate to control for overall wing size).

codes for genes
wt: wild-type
rho: rhomboid (rho[KG07115]) 
Egfr: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (Egfr[k05115])
Bs: Blistered (bs[k07909] also called DSRF - Drosophila serum response factor)
S: Star (S[k09530])
Spi: spitz (spi[s3547])
Aos:  argos (aos[W11])

Goals: (1)Identify non-additive genetic interactions and (2)examine if these interactions varies with genetic background.
