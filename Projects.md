Examining Genetic Background Effects in Epistatic Interactions

Using this dataset there are a few questions that I would like be
answered if chosen for a final project. Firstly, I would like to be able
to distinguish what double or triple mutants have significant
non-additive or epistatic effects. Meaning that double mutants have
significantly shorter or longer vein length or wing length compared to a
single rho mutant. I also want to be able judge the magnitude or
strength of these interactions in a statistical sense. I would also like
to compare these relationships as a function of genetic background. For
example, does the type of genetic interaction or magnitude of genetic
interaction change between genotypes in each background? This would
include looking at variances in vein length and wing length between
genotypes and between genetic backgrounds (ORE or SAM).
